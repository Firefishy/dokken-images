Images for use with kitchen-dokken
==================================
For use with [kitchen-dokken](https://github.com/test-kitchen/kitchen-dokken) published to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dokken/).

Overview
========
Distro provided Docker images are very minimal. Most of the time, when
using `kitchen-dokken` to develop Chef Infra recipes, you'll need to install
various packages into the image as a prerequisite for testing.

Tired of doing that over and over again?
Builds feel slower than they could be?

Use the images in this repo speed things up a bit.
